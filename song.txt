How little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover


How little we understand - what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion - when two tingles intermingle

Who cares to define
Who cares with your mine lips on 
How ignorant bliss is

How little we understand - what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion - when two tingles intermingle
